# Air Pollution Prediction in Ho Chi Minh City using CNN-BiLSTM

## üìå Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for **time series prediction of PM2.5 air pollution concentration** in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  
The approach integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for feature extraction and **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** networks for temporal sequence modeling.

Air pollution, especially PM2.5, is a critical environmental issue in urban areas. Accurate forecasting helps provide early warnings, support decision-making, and protect public health.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier treatment  
   - Feature scaling using Min-Max normalization  
   - Transforming time series into supervised learning format  

2. **Model Architecture (CNN-BiLSTM)**
   - **CNN module**: 1D Convolutions + MaxPooling for feature extraction  
   - **Bi-LSTM module**: Captures sequential dependencies in both forward and backward directions  
   - **Dense layer**: Outputs PM2.5 prediction  

3. **Baselines for comparison**
   - LSTM  
   - Bi-LSTM  
   - CNN  
   - CNN-LSTM  
   - ARIMA
